# Getting Started with Create React App

This Repo is for learning purpose, I am creating some mini projects here with basic concepts of React.

### Projects Path
* restaurent-page/src/component
* seven folder are there inside component and core files also there. These folders are responsible for their unique project.
* App.js is responsible to import all the projects.
* index.js import App.js and display all the outputs.

# Projects

## Restaurent Page
* restaurent page created with manual api which have some data that we will display on front end. Also have category filteration functionality with Menu Bar.

## Hooks
* useState -> this is performing increase and decrease the counting with click event.
* useEffect -> this is performing incr or decr with number counting on title, like whatsapp msg counting are shown with whatsapp title, how many msgs are there it will show.
* useReducer -> same functionality as useState, but it achieves with useReducer hook.

## Todo List
* todo list with crud operations, also use localstorage concept.

## Weather info
* get information of weather according to city name from open source api of https://openweathermap.org/ , just create account on this website and generate your api in free, and use in your code to fetch data using the api.

## Covid Tracker
* get covid details from the real time api, like total cases, recovered, deaths etc.

## Digital Clock
* It is a digital clock usign hooks.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### inside the blog folder `npm run blog` and inside restaurent-page folder `npm run start` 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
